# OCA for Krita

[*OCA*, the Open Cel Animation format](http://rxlaboratory.org/tools/oca/) is an open format to ease the exchange of traditionnal/frame-by-frame/cel animation between different applications.

It is able to export all animation keyframes from a Krita document, keeping the layer structure, blending modes, and a lot of other information. This *OCA* format can then be imported in another application like *Adobe After Effects* or [*Blender*](http://blender.org).

The documentation about *OCA* is available on [oca.rxlab.guide](http://oca.rxlab.guide).

This is the ***OCA* exporter for Krita**.
