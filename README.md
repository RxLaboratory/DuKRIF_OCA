# OCA - Open Cel Animation exporter for Krita

Exports Animation keyframes from Krita to [OCA](https://rxlaboratory.org/tools/oca), a *JSON* + *PNG*/*EXR* format.

## Relocation notice!

The canonical repository for OCA is [on
Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/RxLaboratory/OCA-Krita) but we maintain [a
mirror on GitHub](https://github.com/RxLaboratory/OCA-Krita/tree/master) for the
time being in order to ease the transition. Please update your links
and git remotes.

The repo on github will be left around for a time as a convenience offered to those who haven't yet created a Codeberg account. You can still submit pull requests. However, be sure to branch from master for your pull requests instead of this branch!
